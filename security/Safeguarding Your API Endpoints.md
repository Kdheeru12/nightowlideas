Some common mistakes to avoid when designing endpoints.

## Unauthenticated Endpoints (Potential for DDoS Attacks):

Unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which can overwhelm servers with a flood of illegitimate requests. Mitigate this risk by implementing measures such as:

- **Rate Limiting and IP Blocking:** Restricting excessive requests from individual sources.

## Signup Endpoints:

Signup endpoints are prone to abuse by bots and malicious users aiming to create fake accounts. To prevent this:

- **CAPTCHA Verification:** Ensuring human interaction during the signup process.

- **Rate Limiting:** Restrict the number of signup requests from a single IP address within a specific timeframe to mitigate spam registrations.

## Login Endpoints:

Weak authentication mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access and brute force attacks. Enhance security by:

- **Enforcing Password Complexity Requirements:** Include a minimum length, combination of alphanumeric characters, and avoid common dictionary words.

- **Account Lockout Mechanisms:** Temporarily block access after a certain number of failed login attempts to deter brute force attacks.

A login endpoint susceptible to brute force attacks due to the absence of account lockout measures.

## Verification/Reset Endpoints:

Endpoints responsible for verifying or resetting user credentials are critical for account security. Ensure:

- **Input Validation:**: Preventing injection attacks and maintaining data integrity.
- **Token Expiry:** : Setting expiration times for verification/reset tokens to prevent replay attacks.


## APIs with Guessable Patterns:

Endpoints with predictable patterns in their URLs are vulnerable to enumeration attacks.

- **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Restrict access to authorized users only.

- **Avoid Predictable Patterns:** Use randomly generated or cryptographically secure identifiers.
- **Rate Limiting and Access Controls:** Reduce the effectiveness of enumeration attempts.

## Endpoints Connecting to External Services:

Endpoints connecting to external services, such as sending SMS, making phone calls, or interacting with services like S3, must be carefully designed to prevent abuse and excessive usage, which can lead to unexpectedly high costs.

- **Robust Logging Mechanisms:** Track usage and detect anomalies.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Prevent unauthorized access and abuse.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Restrict the number of requests within a specified timeframe.

- **Monitor Usage Patterns:** Identify any suspicious activity or unusual spikes in usage for timely intervention.
